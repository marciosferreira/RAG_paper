## 1. Executive Summary

AICube is an advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system designed to provide accurate, context-aware responses to user queries across any knowledge domain. The system features multimodal capabilities, integrating text, image, and audio processing to create a comprehensive information retrieval and response generation platform. Built with efficiency in mind, AICube leverages local small language models (SLMs) and adopts a modular, containerized architecture for easy deployment and scalability.

This technical report details the architecture, components, implementation, and deployment of the AICube system, highlighting its innovative features and technical design decisions.

## 2. System Architecture

### 2.1 High-Level Architecture

AICube follows a modular architecture with clearly separated components for data ingestion, processing, indexing, retrieval, and response generation. The system is built around these key components:

1. **Data Ingestion Pipeline**: Processes documents (PDFs, Word) and extracts text and images
2. **Vector Database**: Stores and indexes document embeddings for semantic search
3. **Query Processing System**: Enhances user queries for better retrieval
4. **Multimodal Processing**: Handles text, images, and audio inputs/outputs
5. **Language Model Integration**: Uses quantized language models (LLMs) for efficient response generation
6. **Graph-based Workflow**: Manages the state and flow of information through the system

### 2.2 Component Diagram

See [docs/diagrams/component_diagram.mmd](docs/diagrams/component_diagram.mmd) for the full component diagram.

### 2.3 Data Flow

1. Documents are ingested and processed into markdown with extracted images
2. Content is chunked into parent-child hierarchical structure
3. Chunks are converted to embeddings and indexed in FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search)
4. Images are processed with vision models to generate descriptive text
5. User queries (text or transcribed audio) are processed and enhanced
6. Enhanced query is converted to embeddings for similarity search
7. Relevant document chunks and images are retrieved
8. Retrieved content forms context for the language model
9. Language model generates responses based on retrieved context and conversation history

## 3. Key Components

### 3.1 Document Processing and Indexing

The document processing pipeline handles the conversion, extraction, and indexing of content from various sources:

- **PDF Processing**: Uses Docling to convert PDFs to markdown while preserving images and tables
- **Hierarchical Chunking**: Creates two-level chunks (parent/child) for context preservation
  - Parent chunks contain broader context (sections)
  - Child chunks contain specific details (paragraphs)
- **Vector Indexing**: Uses FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) for efficient similarity search
  - Vectors generated using `sentence-transformers/gtr-t5-large` embeddings
  - Index stored locally for persistence

### 3.2 Multimodal Processing

AICube incorporates multiple modalities for comprehensive information processing:

- **Text Processing**: Core functionality for document content and user queries
- **Image Processing**: A multi-stage pipeline to extract and enrich images with captions, ensuring they are indexed alongside textual content:
  1. PDF → Markdown conversion (data_ingestion/processor/pdf_processor.py):
     - Uses Docling's `DocumentConverter` with `ImageRefMode.REFERENCED` to export figures and tables as image files, inserting `![alt text](path/to/image.png)` references without captions.
  2. Automated image captioning (data_ingestion/processor/images_description.py):
     - `MarkdownImageDescriber` loads a vision model based on `model_vision_repo_id` in data_ingestion/config.yaml:
       - **LLaMA Vision** (`meta-llama/Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct`): high-quality descriptions, requires ≥24 GB GPU.
       - **BLIP** (`Salesforce/blip-image-captioning-base`): lightweight alternative for modest GPUs.
     - Generates a textual caption for each image and injects a `_Image Description: <caption>_` line immediately below the Markdown image tag.
  3. Chunking enriched Markdown (data_ingestion/processor/chunker.py):
     - Converts each `![...](path)` to `[IMAGE: path]` markers and preserves the injected description text in both parent and child chunks.
  4. Indexing and retrieval:
     - Both text and image descriptions are embedded (via sentence-transformers) and indexed in FAISS.
     - During RAG, retrieved chunks include relevant image descriptions, enabling the LLM to select and return illustrative images alongside textual answers.
- **Audio Processing**:
  - Transcribes speech using Whisper model
  - Converts audio queries to text for processing

### 3.3 Query Enhancement

The system implements intelligent query processing to improve retrieval quality:

- **Query Modification**: Enhances user queries with relevant document sections
- **Semantic Search**: Uses vector similarity to find relevant content
- **Context Management**: Maintains conversation history for coherent interactions

### 3.4 Language Model Integration

AICube uses efficient language models for various tasks:

- **Response Generation**: LLaMA 3.1-8B-Instruct (4-bit quantized)
- **Image Description**: LLaMA-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct (high-quality, GPU ≥24 GB) or Salesforce/blip-image-captioning-base (lightweight BLIP model for modest GPUs)
- **Speech-to-Text**: Whisper (ongoing integration)

Quantization (4-bit) is used to reduce memory requirements while maintaining model quality.

### 3.5 Graph-based Workflow

LangGraph is a Python library for defining stateful, directed computational graphs. Each node is a function that transforms a shared `State` object, and edges—regular or conditional—control execution order and branching based on state. In AICube, we build our graph in `src/graph_builder.py`:

- Nodes are implemented in `src/nodes.py` and registered via `builder.add_node(name, function)`.
- Execution flow is defined with `builder.add_edge(src, dst)` and `builder.add_conditional_edges(node, decision_fn)`.
- After calling `builder.compile()`, we invoke the graph via `graph.invoke(initial_state)` in our API/chat loop.

This setup provides:

- **State Management**: A centralized `State` stores query, context, embeddings, and conversation history.
- **Node-based Processing**: Modular functions handle discrete steps (e.g., embedding retrieval, query modification).
- **Branching Logic**: Conditional edges select paths (e.g., RAG vs. specialized tool pipeline).

**Main RAG workflow sequence**:

1. START → **context_decision_node**: decide between RAG and the plans comparison tool.
2. If tool path: **plans_comparison_tool** → **create_system_message** → ... (tool-specific prompt & answer).
3. RAG path: **use_RAG** initializes the RAG branch.
4. **modify_query_node** optionally expands the query for better retrieval.
5. **verify_embeddings_similarity_on_FAISS** computes embeddings, queries FAISS, retrieves document chunks (supports parent/child hierarchy).
6. **bring_conversation_history** merges retrieved chunks with past dialog turns.
7. **create_system_message** formats the system prompt with context and instructions.
8. **build_prompt_template** assembles the final model prompt.
9. **llm_call** invokes the language model to generate a response.
10. **validate_answer** checks the model output; if the model responds with “I don’t know,” it may loop back to RAG or tool.
11. **check_history_lenght** assesses if the conversation history exceeds configured limits.
12. **make_history_short** truncates history if needed → END.

This graph-based design ensures clear separation of concerns, easy extension with new nodes or branches, and transparent, auditable workflows.
