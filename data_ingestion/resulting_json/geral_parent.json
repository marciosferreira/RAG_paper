We hope every baby will sleep safely, warm and sound.\n\n- · Babies sleeping in the same bed with others is one of the risk factors for sudden infant death syndrome. Even with parents or multiple siblings, it is recommended for infant to sleep in the same room but on different beds.\n- · When using a towel or blanket to keep your baby warm, you should wrap it your baby's chest and expose their arms to reduce the chance of the towel or blanket covering your baby's face, or wear a one-piece or sleeping bag-type baby pajamas.\n- · The surface of the crib must be solid and flat, and there must be no soft objects such as pillows, stuffed toys, etc. Do not allow babies to sleep on sofas, chairs, cushions or on their parents or caregivers.\n- · To prevent overheating, do not put on too much clothing on your baby or wrap him or her too tightly. Ensure good ventilation if there are no air conditioning available.\n- · Ensure a smoke-free environment for your baby, and do not allow anyone to smoke near your loved one.\n\n[IMAGE: md-with-image-refs_artifacts/image_000045_559ae18743038238178d01287ed8de55c7e02d55079a46aaa6cfea4738823d53.png]\n_Image Description: a photo of a baby in a cribt_\n\n",

To minimize driver distraction and ensure the safety of vehicle occupants as well as other road users, avoid using the touchscreen to adjust settings while the vehicle is in motion.\n\nUse the touchscreen to control many features that, in traditional cars, are controlled using physical buttons (for example, adjusting the cabin heating and air conditioning, headlights, etc.). You also use the touchscreen to control media, navigate, use entertainment features, and customize Model 3 to suit your preferences. For hands-free access to common touchscreen controls, use voice commands (see Voice Commands on page 16).\n\nIf the touchscreen is unresponsive or demonstrates unusual behavior, you can restart it (see Restarting the Touchscreen on page 8).\n\n[IMAGE: md-with-image-refs_artifacts/image_000015_0deed236d942439abd7573e82f8ad9b848b238228ef1ef48e821cc98a736d067.png]\n_Image Description: a photo of a yellow triangle with a black arrow_\n\nCAUTION: Do not apply a screen protector on the touchscreen.

To minimize driver distraction and ensure the safety of vehicle occupants as well as other road users, avoid using the touchscreen to adjust settings while the vehicle is in motion.\n\nUse the touchscreen to control many features that, in traditional cars, are controlled using physical buttons (for example, adjusting the cabin heating and air conditioning, headlights, etc.). You also use the touchscreen to control media, navigate, use entertainment features, and customize Model 3 to suit your preferences. For hands-free access to common touchscreen controls, use voice commands (see Voice Commands on page 16).\n\nIf the touchscreen is unresponsive or demonstrates unusual behavior, you can restart it (see Restarting the Touchscreen on page 8).\n\n[IMAGE: md-with-image-refs_artifacts/image_000015_0deed236d942439abd7573e82f8ad9b848b238228ef1ef48e821cc98a736d067.png]\n_Image Description: a photo of a yellow triangle with a black arrow_\n_Image Description: a photo of a yellow triangle with a black arrow_\n_Image Description: a photo of a yellow triangle with a black arrow_\n_Image Description: s | | | | | | |_\n_Image Description: s | | | | | | |_\n\nCAUTION: Do not apply a screen protector on the touchscreen. Doing so can result in unintended inputs to the touchscreen (phantom inputs), delayed response or unresponsiveness to touches, electrostatic discharge which can damage the touchscreen, etc. Any damage caused by installing a screen protector is not covered by the warranty.\n\nNOTE: Illustrations are provided to improve conceptual understanding only. Depending on vehicle options, software version, market region and regional and language settings, the details displayed on the screen will differ .\n\n[IMAGE: md-with-image-refs_artifacts/image_000016_afeb98486d5787bbef0971b18df13c83596119ec0eea6d38fdff1dee3fe03e4f.png]\n_Image Description: a photo of a car with a gps app_\n_Image Description: a photo of a car with a gps app_\n_Image Description: a photo of a car with a gps app_\n_Image Description: s | | | | | | |_\n_Image Description: s | | | | | | |_\n\n- 1.
